        <h3>History of Taxila</h3>
        <p>The original name of Taxila was “Takshashila” meaning ‘City of Cut Stone’. Ancient Taxila is a renowned archeological site with a history dating back to the 6th century, 
            BC. Since then, it has been a hub of different cultures including Gandhara, Buddhism, Greek, Mauryan, Kushan, Huns, and Islam. Its affluence in antique times resulted from its location at the intersection 
            of the three great trade routes from eastern India, western Asia, Kashmir, and Central Asia. When these routes ceased to be important, the city sank into insignificance. 
            It was lost to time for nearly 1000 years and was rediscovered in 1880 by Sir Alexander Cunningham and Sir John Hubert Marshall. The remains of the earliest Taxila are marked by the presence of 
            stupas (Place used by monks to meditate) and statues. The five prominent stupas include Dharmarajika, Glen of Giri, Julian, Mohra Moradu, and Jandial. Statues of legendary people in history such as Alexander, 
            the Great, and the eminent ruler Asoka was also found in the city of Taxila. It is interesting to note that part of the original Grand trunk road also passes through ancient Taxila.</p>            
        <p>Over a period of time, the present-day Taxila has emerged as a modern city, with all facilities including the establishment of the University of Engineering and Technology and the famous Taxila Museum. It is surrounded by Orchids which offers Oranges giving an exclusive culinary experience. The establishment of Mabila Resort at Khanpur dam is also an indicator of modernization. The age-old art of stone cutting has been transformed into modern-day Pottery, a skill which Taxila is famous for.</p>
